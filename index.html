                        Hello, my name is Thomas Winters. I am originally from Tennessee where I studied mathematics at the University of Tennessee.
                        When I graduated college, I decided to move somewhere different and chose Minnesota as my mom and
                        her family lived there. I have worked mainly in retail and hospitality moving from OfficeMax to Applebee's
                        and then to Renters Warehouse. I enjoyed the people aspect of the jobs, taking care of them, helping
                        them acquire and purchase what they wanted and so forth; however, there was a lack of motivation
                        from these positions that I could not find. I decided to look at what I wanted in my career and this
                        lead me to looking at a coding boot camp. I joined the web developer boot camp at the University
                        of Minnesota as I felt this was exactly the challenge and motivation I needed. I get to be creative,
                        logical and more importantly, I get to continue my ability to help others.
                    </p>

                    <div class="col-md">
                        <p>
                            Besides my professional side, I enjoy reading, watching movies/television and have been really committed on becoming more
                            fit and healthier. My guilty pleasure is of course, YouTube. I never understood the spiral of
                            YouTube until it took me for a joy ride one evening. Watching video after video about all sorts
                            of things is fascinating to me and can keep me occupied for hours. I have grown out of it lately,
                            but I used to love playing video games, more specifically, first person shooters. Used to be
                            a great stress reliever, but boot camp has kept me busy.
